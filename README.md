# Cryptography-Projects
Contains projects done during my Spring 2022 Semester for my cryptography class.

  Char_Freq.py is able to perform two functions. First, it reads the contents of the text file and plots
the number of ascii characters on a histogram, and then saves it to a png file. The second function is the 
same but instead of ascii characters, it's alpha-numeric characters.
